Societalize
Overview

Societalize is a cross-platform mobile application built using React Native and Expo, designed to revolutionize the way campus-based societies interact with students. It offers a unique social network for societies and their members to communicate, collaborate, and market their activities. This app allows students to directly contact, register, and engage with various societies, fostering a vibrant campus community.
Features

    Direct Interaction: Students can directly interact with any society registered on the platform.
    Event Marketing: Societies can market their events, membership drives, and other activities.
    Society Member Groups: Create exclusive groups for society members for internal communication.
    Social Media Integration: Share and post on integrated social media platforms.
    Public Announcements: Make public announcements for events and other society activities.
    Cross-Platform Availability: Accessible on Android, iOS, and web platforms.

Vision

Our vision is to create a unified platform that not only enhances the visibility of campus societies but also simplifies and enriches the student engagement experience.
